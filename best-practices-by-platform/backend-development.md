# Backend Development Best Practices with Augment Code

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive best practices for using Augment Code effectively when developing backend services and APIs. It covers multiple languages and frameworks including Node.js, Python, Java, .NET, Go, and microservices architecture.

## 1. Structuring Requests for Backend Development

### Backend-Specific Request Structure
- **Technology Stack**: Language, framework, database, and key libraries
- **Architecture Pattern**: Monolith, microservices, serverless, or event-driven
- **Scale Requirements**: Expected load, performance targets, availability needs
- **Infrastructure Context**: Cloud provider, containerization, orchestration
- **Security Requirements**: Authentication, authorization, compliance needs

### Well-Structured Backend Request Examples

#### API Performance Optimization
```
I need to optimize the performance of my Node.js Express API that's experiencing slow response times. The API serves a React frontend with 10,000+ daily active users, uses MongoDB with Mongoose, and implements JWT authentication. The /api/products endpoint is taking 2-3 seconds to respond when filtering through 50,000+ products. I need to reduce response time to under 500ms while maintaining data consistency.
```

#### Microservices Architecture Migration
```
I want to break down my monolithic Python Django application into microservices. The current app handles user management, order processing, inventory management, and payment processing. It uses PostgreSQL, Redis for caching, and Celery for background tasks. I need to design service boundaries, implement inter-service communication, and maintain data consistency across services.
```

#### Database Scaling Issues
```
My Java Spring Boot application is experiencing database bottlenecks with PostgreSQL. The app handles e-commerce transactions with 1000+ concurrent users during peak hours. Main issues are slow complex queries joining multiple tables, connection pool exhaustion, and long-running transactions blocking other operations. I need to implement proper indexing, query optimization, and connection management.
```

#### Security Implementation
```
I need to implement comprehensive security for my .NET Core Web API serving a financial application. Requirements include OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, role-based access control, API rate limiting, input validation, SQL injection prevention, and audit logging. The API handles sensitive financial data and must comply with PCI DSS standards.
```

## 3. Providing Backend Development Context

### Essential Backend Context Elements
- **Technology Stack**: "Node.js 18, Express 4.18, MongoDB 6.0, Redis 7.0"
- **Architecture**: "Microservices with Docker containers on AWS ECS"
- **Scale**: "10,000 DAU, 500 RPS peak, 99.9% uptime requirement"
- **Database**: "PostgreSQL with read replicas, 10GB data, complex joins"
- **Security**: "JWT authentication, role-based access, GDPR compliance"

### Backend-Specific Context Examples

#### Good vs Better Context
```
Good: "The API is slow"
Better: "The GET /api/orders endpoint is responding in 3-5 seconds under 100 concurrent users. The endpoint joins 4 tables (orders, users, products, payments) and returns paginated results. Using Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM, no caching currently implemented."

Good: "Database queries are slow"
Better: "PostgreSQL queries on the products table (500K records) are taking 2+ seconds. Main query filters by category, price range, and availability with ORDER BY created_at. Current indexes on id and category only. Query plan shows sequential scans on price and availability columns."

Good: "Need to add authentication"
Better: "Need to implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens for a multi-tenant SaaS API. Requirements include role-based permissions, session management, password reset flow, and integration with existing user database. API serves both web and mobile clients."
```

### Configuration Context
```javascript
// package.json dependencies
{
  "express": "^4.18.2",
  "mongoose": "^6.8.0",
  "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.0",
  "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
  "redis": "^4.5.0"
}

// Environment configuration
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

## 4. Leveraging Codebase Retrieval for Backend Projects

### Backend-Specific Retrieval Patterns
- "Show me how authentication flows through the middleware stack"
- "Find all database queries and their performance characteristics"
- "How are we handling error responses and logging across endpoints?"
- "Where are we implementing input validation and sanitization?"
- "Show me the current API routing structure and endpoint organization"

### Architecture Understanding Queries
- "Help me understand the service layer architecture and dependencies"
- "How are we handling database transactions and data consistency?"
- "Where are we implementing caching and what's the cache strategy?"
- "Show me how background jobs and async processing are implemented"
- "How are we handling configuration and environment management?"

### Performance Analysis Queries
- "Find endpoints that might be causing performance bottlenecks"
- "Show me where we're making database calls and how they're optimized"
- "Where are we handling concurrent requests and rate limiting?"
- "How are we managing memory usage and potential memory leaks?"

## 5. Iterating on Backend Development Solutions

Me: [Analyzes codebase] "I can see you're making multiple database queries per request without proper indexing or caching. Let me examine your endpoint implementations and database schema..."

You: "Yes, and we're also seeing high memory usage and occasional timeouts."

Me: [Provides optimization plan] "Here's a comprehensive approach: implement query optimization with proper indexes, add Redis caching for frequently accessed data, implement connection pooling, and add request batching..."

You: "That sounds good, but I'm also concerned about maintaining data consistency."

Me: [Addresses consistency concerns] "Let me show you how to implement proper transaction management, add cache invalidation strategies, and implement eventual consistency patterns where appropriate..."
