# Web Development Best Practices with Augment Code

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive best practices for using Augment Code effectively when developing web applications. It covers modern web technologies including React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript development.

## 1. Structuring Requests for Web Development

### Web-Specific Request Structure
- **Framework Context**: Specify React, Vue, Angular, or vanilla JS/TS
- **Build Tools**: Mention Webpack, Vite, Parcel, or other bundlers
- **State Management**: Include Redux, Vuex, NgRx, or context-based solutions
- **Styling Approach**: CSS-in-JS, SCSS, Tailwind, styled-components
- **Performance Requirements**: Bundle size, loading time, SEO needs

### Well-Structured Web Request Examples

#### React Performance Optimization
```
I need to optimize the rendering performance of my React dashboard application. The app uses React 18 with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit for state management, and Material-UI components. Users are experiencing slow interactions when filtering through 1000+ data rows in a table component. The app needs to maintain 60fps during scrolling and filtering operations.
```

#### Vue.js Architecture Migration
```
I want to migrate my Vue 2 application to Vue 3 with Composition API while maintaining the current Vuex store structure. The app has 15 components using Options API, Vue Router for navigation, and Axios for API calls. I need to preserve existing functionality while adopting modern Vue 3 patterns and improving TypeScript integration.
```

#### Angular Enterprise Setup
```
I'm building a large-scale Angular enterprise application with micro-frontend architecture. The app needs to support multiple teams working independently, shared component libraries, and consistent state management across modules. Using Angular 15, NgRx for state management, and Angular Material for UI components.
```

#### Full-Stack Integration
```
I need to implement real-time features in my MERN stack application. The frontend uses React with Socket.io-client, and the backend is Node.js with Express and Socket.io. I want to add live chat, real-time notifications, and collaborative editing features while maintaining good performance and handling connection failures gracefully.
```

- **State Management**: "Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for API calls"
- **Styling Solution**: "Tailwind CSS with custom design system"
- **Target Environment**: "Modern browsers, mobile-first, PWA support"

### Web-Specific Context Examples

#### Good vs Better Context
```
Good: "The component is rendering slowly"
Better: "The ProductList component with 500+ items is causing frame drops during scroll. Using React 18, each item renders product image, title, price, and rating. No virtualization currently implemented."

Good: "Need to add authentication"
Better: "Need to implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, supporting Google OAuth and email/password login. Using React with Context for state management, need to protect routes and handle token expiration gracefully."

Good: "The bundle is too large"
Better: "Production bundle is 2.5MB gzipped, target is under 1MB. Using React, Material-UI, and several utility libraries. Need code splitting and tree shaking optimization while maintaining current functionality."
```

### Package.json Context
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.8.0",
    "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.9.1",
    "@mui/material": "^5.11.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^4.0.0",
    "typescript": "^4.9.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0"
  }
}
```

## 4. Leveraging Codebase Retrieval for Web Projects

### Web-Specific Retrieval Patterns
- "Show me how data flows from API calls to component rendering"
- "Find all places where we're managing authentication state"
- "How is routing configured and what are the protected routes?"
- "Where are we handling form validation and error states?"
- "Show me the current component hierarchy and prop drilling patterns"

### Architecture Understanding Queries
- "Help me understand the state management architecture"
- "How are we handling side effects and async operations?"
- "Where are we implementing error boundaries and error handling?"
- "Show me how the build process and bundling is configured"
- "How are we organizing components and shared utilities?"

### Performance Analysis Queries
- "Find components that might be causing unnecessary re-renders"
- "Show me where we're loading large dependencies or assets"
- "Where are we making API calls and how are they optimized?"

```
You: "My React dashboard is slow when users interact with the data table containing 1000+ rows."

Me: [Analyzes codebase] "I can see you're rendering all rows at once without virtualization. Let me examine your component structure and data flow..."

You: "Yes, and users need to be able to sort, filter, and select multiple rows efficiently."

Me: [Provides optimization plan] "Here's a comprehensive approach: implement virtual scrolling with react-window, optimize your filtering logic with useMemo, and add proper key props for efficient reconciliation..."

You: "That sounds good, but I also need to maintain the current selection state when filtering."

Me: [Addresses state management] "Let me show you how to implement a robust selection system that persists across filters and maintains performance..."
```
